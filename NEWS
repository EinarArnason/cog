=======================
0.12.3 - March 23, 2022
=======================

- wl: Fixed a crash related to usage of features not available in
  versions of interfaces negotiated with the Wayland compositor.

=======================
0.12.2 - March 23, 2022
=======================

- Fixed the location passed by CMake to the compiler with the platform
  plug-ins to ensure it is always an absolute path.

==========================
0.12.1 - February 24, 2022
==========================

- wl: Fixed handling of supported Wayland protocol versions, preventing a
  crash with certain compositors which advertise support for newer versions
  than actually supported by the client.
- Fixed the location used by CMake to install platform plug-ins.

==========================
0.12.0 - November 24, 2021
==========================

- This release does not contain changes over the 0.11.90 development release.

===========================
0.11.90 - November 11, 2021
===========================

- core: Removed cog_platform_teardown(), deinitilization of platform
  plug-in implementations is now done automatically as part of object
  finalization.
- core: Fixed building the documentation when using libsoup3.
- drm: Fixed two small memory leaks during initialization.

=========================
0.11.1 - November 3, 2021
=========================

- core: Changed platform plug-ins to be able to automatically detect which
  one should be used. Passing the "--platform=" command line option to the
  launcher is now optional.
- core: Added support for building against libsoup3.
- core: Added CogHostRoutesHandler, which can route URI scheme requests
  with different host parts to other handlers.
- core, cog: Added support for running in WebDriver automation mode.
- cog: New "--enable-sandbox" command line option, which allows isolating
  rendering processes from the rest of the system.
- cog: New "--content-filter=" command line option, which allows loading
  a content blocker (WebKitUserContentFilter) JSON rule set.
- drm: Implemented handling of pointer axis/wheel/finger/continuous events
  and absolute motion events.
- wl: Renamed "fdo" platform module to "wl" (Wayland) as it better reflects
  its usage; the old name still works e.g. when using "cog --platform=fdo"
  but it is considered deprecated and will cause a warning.
- wl, gtk4: Added support for fullscreening web views.
- gtk4: Honor the CogShell.device-scale-factor property.

======================
0.9.1 - March 16, 2021
======================

- core: Added CogPrefixRoutesHandler, which can route URI scheme requests
  with different path prefixes to other handlers.
- core: Added new CogShell.device-scale-factor property.
- core: Added support in CogDirectoryFilesHandler to use the URI host part
  as a path component, to ignore a certain amount of path components, and
  expose the base path as a property.
- core: Removed support for building using WebKitGTK, only the WPE port is
  supported now.
- drm: The DRM/KMS platform module is now built by default.
- drm: Added support for key press event repeat.
- drm: Added support for mouse cursor.
- drm: Added support for atomic modesetting, which is automatically used
  by default when support is detected in the video driver.
- drm: Added support for limiting the maximum used video mode width and
  height, settable using the COG_PLATFORM_DRM_MODE_MAX environment variable.
- drm: Fixed usage of the specified output device scaling factor.
- drm: Improve logging output.
- drm, fdo: Added support for SHM buffer exports, which for example allows
  using Mesa's software rasterization.
- fdo: Try using the largest available output video mode when using the
  zwp_fullscreen_shell_v1 protocol.
- headless: Added new "headless" platform module, which does not produce
  output and can be used without any graphics hardware e.g. in combination
  with Mesa's software rasterization.
- x11: Added new "x11" platform module, which uses an X11 window to paint
  rendered web content using XCB and OpenGL.

======================
0.7.1 - April 11, 2020
======================

- Support keeping a reference to the configuration file, which platform
  plug-ins can use to obtain their own configuration options.
- fdo: Added support for option menus.
- fdo: Set a default pointer cursor.
- fdo: Removed redundant EGL state.
- fdo: Fix possible usage of uninitialized libxkbcommon structures.

=====================
0.3.1 - June 28, 2018
=====================

- Fix installed cogcore.pc file to use the correct wpe-webkit-1.0 module as
  dependency.
- fdo: Use wayland-scanner and wayland-protocols to generate Wayland protocol
  code, instead of shipping pregenerated copies.
- fdo: Improved debug logging.

======================
0.3.0 - March 28, 2018
======================

- Support configuring the background color of the Web view.
- Add an option to control permission requests.
- The output of "cog --help-websettings" now is sorted alphabetically by
  option name.
- Properly handle URIs in the command line in some corner cases, for example
  when they include passwords or fragment identifiers.
- fdo: Avoid dereferencing a NULL view backend by creating the Wayland event
  source always after a valid backend is instantiated
- fdo: Set the opaque region of Wayland surfaces when fullscreened, which
  allows the compositor to optimize redraws.

=========================
0.2.0 - December 13, 2018
=========================

- fdo: Fix potential screen tearing by releasing each EGLImage on the
  release callback for its wl_buffer.
- fdo: Explicitly set the backend library name.
- Fix remotely controlling Cog over D-Bus.

=========================
