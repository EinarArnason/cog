  supported now.
- drm: The DRM/KMS platform module is now built by default.

  using Mesa's software rasterization.
- fdo: Try using the largest available output video mode when using the
  zwp_fullscreen_shell_v1 protocol.
- headless: Added new "headless" platform module, which does not produce
  output and can be used without any graphics hardware e.g. in combination
  with Mesa's software rasterization.
- x11: Added new "x11" platform module, which uses an X11 window to paint
  rendered web content using XCB and OpenGL.

  when they include passwords or fragment identifiers.
- fdo: Avoid dereferencing a NULL view backend by creating the Wayland event
  source always after a valid backend is instantiated
